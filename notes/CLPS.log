Time spent developing Z -> CLPS translator:

Date		Hours	Task
=============	=====	=================
Mon 3/9/2001	5	Initial main program, derived from Animate.hs
			and TextUI.hs, plus CLPS term writer.

Wed 5/9/2001	4	Improved CLPS term writer a lot and added exceptions.

Tue 11/9/2001	3	Added quantifiers, set-comp and all other toolkit
			operators that are supported by both Z and CLPS-B
			except the relation/function spaces.

Mon 17/9/2001	4	Added type inference for Z expressions, so can 
			generate the correct = operator.
			Changed literal sets to use union-of-singletons
			(because CLPS-B assumes no duplicates).

Thu 27/9/2001	1	Added output of function space constructors.
			Translated long tuples to nested pairs.

Thu 27/9/2001	3	Design of Z -> CLPS-BZ translator.

Fri 28/9/2001	4	First part of BZTT .pl file generation.

Mon 1/10/2001	6	First Prolog-readable bbook.pl file generated.
	Many improvements required in CLPSType.hs (a type env is now
	passed right through the CLPSWrite predicates).
	This is really just an experimental prototype.


Sat 15/6/2002	5	Started to change to BZP format.
	Correct top-level facts generated, but more work needed
	to get types and expressions into BZP syntax.

Tue 18/6/2002	2	More correct BZP output with types.
	Fixed most operators, added types to all/exists quantifiers,
	added "b_" prefix to all names.

Fri 28/6/2002	2	Wrote front end, Z2BZP.hs.
	Sent this to rest of BZTT team for evaluation.
